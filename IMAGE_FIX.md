# Image Loading Fix

## Problem
The original slide components were using external image URLs that were either:
1. Not accessible due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions
2. URL references that may have expired or changed
3. Images from sites that require authentication

## Solution
All external image references were replaced with styled divs that:
1. Use background colors, gradients, and proper sizing to maintain layout
2. Include descriptive text indicating what the image would have shown
3. Maintain the proper visual hierarchy of the slides

## Files Modified
- TitleSlide.jsx
- PathophysiologySlide.jsx
- QuestionsSlide.jsx
- DiseaseDefinitionSlide.jsx
- NasalSprayTechniqueSlide.jsx
- ObjectivesSlide.jsx

## Better Approach for Production
For a production application, you would:
1. Download all needed images and store them locally in `/public/images/`
2. Reference them with relative paths like `src="/images/filename.jpg"`
3. Ensure all images are properly compressed and optimized
4. Consider using an image CDN for better performance

## Current Implementation
The current implementation uses CSS-styled divs as placeholders that:
- Match the intended dimensions of the original images
- Use appropriate background colors/gradients
- Include descriptive text of what would be shown in the images
