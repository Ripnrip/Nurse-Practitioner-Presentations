          The cough reflex is initiated by stimulation of sensory receptors in the respiratory tract, mediated 
          primarily via the vagus nerve, and modulated by higher central nervous system input. It involves 
          the glottis, chest muscles, and accessory respiratory muscles. While cough can occur at any 
          age, chronic cough is more prevalent in adults aged 50â€“60 years, particularly among women 
          who have heightened cough reflex sensitivity.

          Cough is a symptom rather than a disease and can result from various underlying pathologies 
          such as infections (e.g., common cold, pneumonia, TB), inflammatory conditions (e.g., asthma, 
          COPD), environmental exposures, or medication side effects (e.g., ACE inhibitors).
